redmine-light-gray-theme
========================

Light gray theme for [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/), tested on 2.1.2.stable.  Supports the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer.

The javascript is specific to my needs, but everything else can be used with a generic Redmine installation.
